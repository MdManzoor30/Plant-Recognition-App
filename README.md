# Plant-Recognition-App
Me & my team developed a groundbreaking Plant Recognition App that tackles the critical issue of plant species extinction by leveraging advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology. Using EfficientNetB0 architecture, my app enables users to upload plant images and instantly receive accurate species identification along with personalized care instructions. By meticulously curating a dataset from 99 to 52 plant species, I achieved an impressive 95.79% training accuracy and 85.34% testing accuracy. My technical implementation included transfer learning, strategic data preprocessing, and innovative dropout layers to minimize overfitting. The app's broader mission extends beyond technological innovation - it aims to reconnect people with nature, promote environmental conservation, and make plant identification accessible to everyone from botany students to casual gardeners. Developed using Django and deployed on PythonAnywhere, this project represents a significant step towards bridging the knowledge gap in plant recognition and care, ultimately contributing to global sustainability efforts.
